<p>Here is where you add/edit/delete links to images that connect with the files you have uploaded to your server that contain audio/video content. We preload images and links that you can use. You can make your own and edit these listings to reflect your images if you want. We suggest that you add to the list, rather than change these. Upon reinstallation, these original images and paths will be put back in the database, though your new additions will not be affected. These are all 24x24 images. We also preload 16x16 images. If you want to use those, simply change the 24 in the filename to 16. 
<p>If you change the size of the images, be sure to reflect the change in the Preferences. Default it is set to 24x24. 

<p> Click on the New link to add an image. Click a  link to edit  or the checkbox followed by Edit on the top menu. 
<p>Put in a name for the image, a description, a path starting with the Joomla root (but no leading slash), and some ALT text to use and click Save. You can edit them. To delete rows you need to set the Allow Admin Delete Rows option under Preferences. But be careful. If you delete an image that is attached to a study it may cause unintended results.
