<div class="header">Podcast Episodes Help Screen </div>
<p>The listing of podcast episodes is really more for your information, but it provides another way to see them collected together. You can use the drop down boxes to select a particular podcast, or study, and you can select ascending or descending. 
<p>Remember, you can see episodes for each podcast by selecting a podcast from the Podcasts list. One nice thing about this list is you can edit a media file or a podcast by clicking on the link by that podcast episode. </p>
