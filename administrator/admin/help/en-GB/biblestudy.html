<p><strong>Bible Study Message System Help</strong></p>
<p><em>Introduction<a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a></em></p>
<p>Welcome to the Bible Study Message System. This component is designed to help your church communicate the gospel and teachings in the Word of God. com_biblestudy allows you to enter detailed information about the studies given and links to multimedia content you have uploaded to your server. You can also display full text or notes. All this is searchable in many different ways and you have a lot of control over how much information is displayed on the front end. </p>
<p>It is very important that you do a couple of things when you first install the component. 1. Go to Extensions | Bible Study Manager | Servers. You won't see any there because you haven't added them yet. Look on the toolbar for Preferences. Click the link. It opens up a window where you set most of the global parameters of the component. For now, just save the preferences. Now add a server. After you've saved it, click on the Folders link and add a folder under that server. Now you are set to add your first study. Just put in some text to add a new study, then link to the studieslist view as a new menu item and see how the component looks. You can then go back to Preferences and make changes until you get the look you want.</p>
