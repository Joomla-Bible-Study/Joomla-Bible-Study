<div class="header">Media Files Help Screen </div>
<p>This is the area where you enter information about the media files associated with your studies. You can create as many files associated with a study as you want. You can also link this file to a particular podcast by using the drop down boxes.
<p>1. Be sure to mark the media file published or it won't appear anywhere!
<p>2. Create date is important as it's used in the ordering process. Simply click on the calendar and it will default to today's date, or click on the date of the study but that isn't vitally important.
<p>3. Click on the filesize converter to open a window where you can choose Kilobytes, Megabytes, or Gigabytes. The script will do the math and put a byte count in the box.
<p>4. The order is set by the component. New ones default to first place. You can change that in the Media Files list view or by coming back to edit this media file.
<p>5. Mark &quot;yes&quot; if you want this file to be viewed using the AVReloaded plugin. You must have the plugin installed or the component will not create a link to it and you will just have a link directly to the media file. 
<p>6. In the box put the code that will go before and after your media file. The codes are found in the <a href="http://allvideos.fritz-elfert.de/documentation.html" target="_blank">AVReloaded documentation site</a>. I can't vouch for whether or not the plugin will work every time so you might want to experiment. If you enter this text in the box {mp3remote}http://-{/mp3remote} then the component will create a link to the internal media player using this code: {mp3remote}http://serverpath/folderpath/filename{/mp3remote}. If you leave out the server or folder then it uses only what you do enter. So if I have a Google video I would only enter an ID code in the filename box with no server or folder. Then my code would be {google}-{/google}. The component then creates this code {google}-5377502508287522145{/google}. 
<p>7. Select an image from the drop down that corresonds to the type of image you want displayed.
<p>8. Select a server and/or a folder from the drop down. If these are blank then make sure to go to the Servers and Folders admin menus and enter some. Leave blank if you don't want to use them.
<p>9. The filename with extension goes here, or the ID of the streamed file. You could put the whole path here, but having a server/folder helps cut down on typing mistakes! Also - don't use this option if you uploading a file. The component will need the folder information to know where to put your file on your server. To upload a file, simply browse to it and don't put anything in the Filename box as the component will use the name of the file you browsed to instead (even if you put an entry in there, the browsed file name will be subsituted). Notice that there should be a maximum filesize indicated below the Browse line. You cannot upload a file greater than this size unless you change the upload_max_filesize setting in your php.ini file. You may need to get assistance from your host or website administrator to change this setting. If you can't edit your php.ini file you can create a local one in the root folder and in the administrator folder that contains the entry upload_max_filesize = 20M or whatever you want. If you try to upload a file larger than the setting once the server reaches that maximum it will simply leave the component entirely, not upload the file, and return you to the Joomla admin screen.
<p>10. You can enter a target if you want a new browser window to open, for instance. Leave the box blank and target of _self is presumed.
<p>11. In the podcast drop down you can associate this media file with a podcast. Normally you have a podcast with many media file episodes all from different studies.
<p>12. You must select a mime-type if you associate a file with a podcast. This tells iTunes or whatever how to handle the file. If you leave this blank your podcast will not work! 
<p>Press Save and you are done!
