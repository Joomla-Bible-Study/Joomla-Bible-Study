<p>Message Types can be things like Sunday, Wednesday, Mid-Week - anything that helps you describe the service.
<p> Click on the New link to add a message type. Click a  link to edit a message type, or the checkbox followed by Edit on the top menu. 
<p>Put in a name for the message type and click Save. You can edit them. To delete rows you need to set the Allow Admin Delete Rows option under Preferences. But be careful. If you delete a message type that is attached to a study it may cause unintended results.
