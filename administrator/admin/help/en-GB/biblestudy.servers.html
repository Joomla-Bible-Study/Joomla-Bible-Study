<p>Click on the New link to add a new Server. Click a  link to edit a server, or the checkbox followed by Edit on the top menu. 
<p>Put in a name for the server and a path with no trailing /. Like: http://www.mychurchserver.org. If you want, you can skip the folders altogether and just put in a path to your files here like: <br>http://www.mychurchserver.org/mediafiles or something like that. Then just be sure not to use the Folders.
