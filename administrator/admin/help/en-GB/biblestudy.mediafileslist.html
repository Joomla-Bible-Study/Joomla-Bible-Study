<div class="header">Media Files List Help Screen </div>
<p>This is the list of current media files. You come here after you have entered information about your particular study in the Studies menu. You will also need to have entered some teacher, server, and folder information first. This list will likely get pretty long as time goes on so we've put some special functionality on the page to help. The columns are clickable which will change the order ascending or descending on that column. You can also change the order of how you want media files to appear in the studies list. You can do that by clicking the up or down arrow by a study. It will then move up on the list or down. You can also manually type in a new order and click the small disk icon at the top of the column to save the new order.
<p>You can unpubish a media file from this listing or delete or unpublish a whole bunch if you want by checking boxes and hitting Delete at the top. This choice might not be there. To allow deletes you will need to click on Parameters. The top choice is to allow or restrict deletes. We did this just so you don't accidently erase something but it's up to you how you want that configured for your site.
