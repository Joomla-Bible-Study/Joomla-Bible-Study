<div class="header">Podcasts Help Screen </div>
<p>This is the area where you enter information about the podcasts associated with your studies. You probably won't have a great numbe of podcasts. At our church we have two. One is for the mp3 recordings and the other is for a video podcast using m4v files. Click on the podcast title in the list view to edit it, or New to create a new one.
<p>1. If you are editing an existing podcast there will be an icon that appears at the top (this doesn't appear for a new podcast). This is to write your podcast xml file. This routine does not save any changes to the podcast information so you will want to save changes and come back before writing the file. If it is successful you will see a message on the blue line above the Podcast Details table. Error messages will also be displayed if the file can't be opened for writing or if there is an ftp issue. If that occurs you will need to check your file or folder permissions and see if you have entered a user/password in the Joomla global settings. We took the write routine from another portion of the Joomla core so it should work if permissions are set correctly. 
<p>Your finished file can then be linked to by <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fitunes%2Fstore%2Fpodcaststechspecs.html&ei=SGDYR5GoJJaEpAT63aTcDw&usg=AFQjCNGFthA5Yw0TQimM12piu2hDEYulVg&sig2=gpmiVlIXUlGQejJW5IvIZw">iTunes</a> (this link is to the technical specs). You could even create a news feed from the Joomla core to this xml file. If you are curious about what's in it, use JoomlaXplorer or your favorite ftp client to browse to the file. It is most likely in your root folder (that's the safest place to put it anyway). 
<p>2. Be sure to mark the podcast published or it won't appear anywhere!
<p>3.Create a name for the podcast. This will show up in your xml file so make it a public title like &quot;Podcast from Smallville Community Church&quot; (sorry if that's really your church name!)
<p>4. Put in the number of episodes (media files) you want in the podcast. Leaving the row blank means you get all episodes. It may show 0 but is okay (it's a number field so it has to show something!).
<p>5. Next enter your church website. Don't put in the http part, we'll add that when we write the xml file.
<p>6. Now put in some description of your podcast like &quot;Weekly messages to encourage the body of Christ in their walk with the Lord&quot; or whatever. This will show up in the description in the iTunes store and should refer to your overall podcast, not a particular episode.
<p>7. Now put in the url (no http://) to the image associated with your podcast. The maximum size of the image is 300x300. You put the demensions in the next two boxes.
<p>8. Put in the author's name. Usually the teacher associated with the podcast like your senior pastor
<p>9. The podcast logo or image is something just for iTunes. It is 300x300 maximum too but you don't have to enter the demensions.
<p>10. iTunes lets you enter search words. Separate them by commas.
<p>11. Here is where you put in the filename. Don't put in anything but a path from your root like /podcasts/podcast.xml. I recommend that you just put in a filename like mypodcast.xml and let the component put it in the root folder of your site. So the path to your file would be: http://www.mysite.com/mypodcast.xml.
<p>12. Put in a language pair. English is en-us or en-gb. You'll need to know yours.
<p>13. The editor can be a different person than the author if you want.
<p>14. Put in the editor's email address. 
<p>After you have associated some media files to this podcast they will show up below. You can actually click on the filename to edit the media file, or on the study to edit information about that particular study. You can also go to the episodes list and choose a media file or study from that list.<p>Press Save and you are done!
