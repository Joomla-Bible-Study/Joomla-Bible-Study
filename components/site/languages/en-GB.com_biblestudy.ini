You may also put in a file name between the {} and {}. If you do the component will simply pass on that code to AVReloaded. <br /> See <a href="http://allvideos.fritz-elfert.de/documentation.html" target="_blank">AVReloaded Documentation </a> for more information on codes to use.<br />You can insert text before the dash or after if you need to. Like: {mp3remote}http://-{/mp3remote} inserts that text before your path and filename (the system removes the -)
