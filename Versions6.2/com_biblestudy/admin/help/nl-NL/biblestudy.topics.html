<div class="header">Topics Help Screen</div>
<p>We have preloaded a list of topics. They originally came from
	SermonCentral.com. You can add or edit topics but be aware that upon
	reinstallation, the original topics list will be reinstated. New topics
	you put in will not be deleted, however.
<p>Click on the New link to add a topic. Click a link to edit a
	topic, or the checkbox followed by Edit on the top menu.
<p>Put in a name for the topic and click Save. You can edit them. To
	delete rows you need to set the Allow Admin Delete Rows option under
	Preferences. But be careful. If you delete a topic that is attached to
	a study it may cause unintended results.
