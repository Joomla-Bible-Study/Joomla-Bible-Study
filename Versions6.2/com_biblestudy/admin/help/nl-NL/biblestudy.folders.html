<p>Click on the New link to add a new folder. Click a link to edit a
	folder, or the checkbox followed by Edit on the top menu. You should
	add slashes on either side to make a proper path (experiment and you'll
	see what we mean).</p>
<p>Put in a name for the folder and a path and click Save. You can
	edit them. To delete rows you need to set the Allow Admin Delete Rows
	option under Preferences. But be careful. If you delete a folder that
	is attached to a study it may cause unintended results.</p>
