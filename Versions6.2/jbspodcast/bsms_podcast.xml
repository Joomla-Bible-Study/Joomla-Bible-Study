			description="Bible Study Podcast Publish creates a file in the media folder with today's date in it so that it knows to only run this script once a day. If Testing is set to Yes then the plugin will not create this file, consequentially forcing this script to run every time the page is reloaded. This is great if you're testing the script on a quiet server, but if you're on a busy server you'll bring it to it's knees, so use with care!   Also note: If you set this to Yes you will have some output at the top of the page to keep you informed of what the plugin is doing.">
