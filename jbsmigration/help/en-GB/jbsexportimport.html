<strong>Exporting: </strong>Click on the export link to create a backup .sql file of just the Joomla Bible Study tables. This routine will search your database for all instances of the bsms_ table so it doesn't matter what version you are using. </p>
<p>You will be prompted to pick a location for the saved file. Place it somewhere where you can remember as you will need it for the next step. </p>
<p>Note: The database file will also be saved to your website's tmp folder. So if you plan to use the install from folder option from your Joomla 1.6 website, you can simply copy down the file name and save the step of uploading it back up to your website.</p>
<br /><p><strong>Importing (Joomla 1.6): </strong>You can import your database in two different ways. If you wish to upload a database saved to your computer then click the browse button, select that database file and click "submit".</p>
<p>Some large databases may take too long to upload and will surpass your servers maximum time for script execution and time out. In that case, you may wish to upload the database to the tmp folder of your website and paste the filename into the field and press submit</p>
<p>We attempt to reset the maximum execution time but in some cases we cannot. If you consistently get a timeout error you will want to consult your web host on how to edit the php.ini to adjust the max_execution_time.</p><br />
<p><strong>Migrate in place: </strong>Click on this link if you simply wish to migrate your current database in place. You may have not been able to use the import tool and have imported your databse using phpMyAdmin or similar. This link bypasses the upload and import and runs the migration routine directly.</p>
