<div class="header">Bible Books Help Screen</div>
<p>We have preloaded all the books of the Bible. You can also add
	books at the end, for things like holidays or Topical, things like
	that.
<p>Click on the New link to add a book. Click a link to edit a book
	type, or the checkbox followed by Edit on the top menu. Be aware that
	if you reinstall the component it will replace all the original book
	listings.
<p>Put in a name for the book and click Save. You can edit them. To
	delete rows you need to set the Allow Admin Delete Rows option under
	Preferences. But be careful. If you delete a book that is attached to a
	study it may cause unintended results.
